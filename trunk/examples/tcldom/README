cgi2dom.tcl
	Not an application, but a package.  Provides the
	'cgi2dom::createdocument' command which accepts a number
	of name-value parameters and returns a DOM tree.

	All parameters whose name starts with '/' are
	interpreted as XPath location paths.  The 'createNode'
	method is used to construct a DOM tree.  The parameter
	values are inserted into the tree as text nodes.

domtree.tcl
	A BWidget mega-widget.  Displays a DOM documents as a
	tree of nodes.  The BWidgets Tree widget provides the
	display.  DOM events are used to maintain the tree view,
	and DOM events are posted in response to Tk events.

domtree-treectrl.tcl
	Similar to above, but uses a treectrl widget.

domtext.tcl
	A Tk mega-widget.  Displays a DOM document in a Tk
	text widget.  Control of the widget's contents is
	at the level of DOM nodes, not lines and characters.
	DOM events are used to maintain the text view and
	DOM events are posted in response to Tk events.
	Character data in the widget is editable.

browser.tcl
	A mini XML browser.  Uses above mega-widgets.

tkxmllint
	An XML document analyzer.  Performs well-formedness check,
	DTD validation or XML Schema validation on a XML document.
